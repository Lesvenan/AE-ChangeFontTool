# AE-ChangeFontTool

You know what bothers me more than not having enough god damn toilet paper for the quarantine? Changing all the text layer’s font in After Effects.

So instead of doing a hunger management workshop, I present you the new AE script : ChangingFontTool Extravaganza.
With this new tool, you can :
- Change all the select text layer, or all the text layers in selected compositions in one click.
- Choose to change only text layers with a specific font, or all the text layers.
- Change their font, but also their font size, their font colour and how they are justified.

And if you have a text layer that is exactly what you want just Shift + Click on the “From” Copy-Icon button so the properties will autofill with your desired text layer properties.
